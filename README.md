# MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION
In this project, I trained logistics regression model to predict if an applicant for loan would default if given the loan, based on information provided at the point of application. The model was trained using the Lending Club dataset. The project involve extensive exploratory data analysis, missing data handling and feature engineering. Also, the dataset used is imbalanced. This is expected because it is normal for the percentage of loan defaulters to be less than non-defaulters. To address the problem associated with the imbalanced dataset, I used oversampling technique to resample the minority class thereby improving my modelâ€™s recall and F1-Score from 0.47 and 0.62 to 0.81 and 0.81 respectively. The area under the ROC was also improved from 0.73 to 0.8. I also built a web application that uses the model to predict loan default.
