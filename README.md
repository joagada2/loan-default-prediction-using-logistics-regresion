# MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION
In this project, I trained logistics regression model to predict if an applicant for loan would default, based on information provided at the point of application. The model was trained using the LendingClub dataset. The project involve extensive exploratory data analysis, missing data handling and feature engineering. Also, the dataset used is unbalanced. This is expected because it is normal for percentage of loan defaulters to be less than non-defaulters. To address the problem associated with the unbalanced dataset, I use oversampling technique to resample the minority class thereby improving my modelâ€™s recall and f1-score from 0.47 and 0.62 to 0.81 and 0.81 respectively. The area under the ROC was also improved from 0.73 to 0.8. I also built web application for deployment of the model using the python flask framework.
